# Goodcabs Performance Analysis

This project involves building an interactive Power BI dashboard for GoodCabs, a cab service operating in tier-2 cities across India. The dashboard provides actionable insights into key metrics such as trip volume, passenger satisfaction, ratings, and revenue trends, enabling better decision-making and strategic planning.

## Problem statement

GoodCabs faces challenges in monitoring key performance indicators like trip volume, repeat passenger rate (RPR%), passenger satisfaction, and revenue contribution across cities. The company needed a centralized dashboard to analyze operational data, uncover trends, and identify areas for improvement. This project aims to address these challenges by delivering a comprehensive dashboard solution.

## The Data
As Codebasics conducted this resume challenge project, they provided the data set  you can [check here](https://codebasics.io/challenge/codebasics-resume-project-challenge/16).

### The dataset includes detailed information about:

Trips: City-wise trip data with passenger types and trip frequencies.  
Passengers: New and repeat passenger counts with ratings.  
Cities and Months: Operational locations and time-based metrics.  
Targets: Goals for trips, new passengers, and average ratings.

## Insights

- Jaipur: Contributes the highest trips (18%) and revenue (₹37.2M, 34%) but relies heavily on new passengers (80%).  
- Lucknow: Ranks second in trips (15%) but has low revenue due to poor ratings and lower average fare per trip.  
- Mysore: Small contributor (4% of trips) but exceeds trip targets by 20%, demonstrating high efficiency and satisfaction (ratings above 8.0).  
- Surat: Leads in Repeat Passenger Rate (42%) but struggles with low ratings due to lower fares.  
- Seasonal Trends: Trips peaked in February and March, declining steadily afterwards, but repeat passenger loyalty increased during off-peak months.
